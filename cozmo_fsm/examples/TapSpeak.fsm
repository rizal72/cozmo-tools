"""
  The TapSpeak demo shows Cozmo responding to cube tap events. A
  TapTrans transition is used to set up a handler for taps. The
  example also illustrates how the TapTrans transition does wildcard
  matching if not given an argument. By passing a cube as an argument
  to the TapTrans constructor can use it to look for taps on a
  specific cube.

  Behavior: Cozmo starts out by saying 'Tap a cube'. Then, every time
  a cube is tapped, Cozmo says the cube name and goes back to
  listening for more tap events.
